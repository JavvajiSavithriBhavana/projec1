                    <p>
                        29 Royal Thalis from 29 States of India.  India as a country is rich in culture, cuisines, and customs. Each region in the country is unique in its own way. As you move from one region to the other in India, the dishes and spices change rapidly. Apart from all the differences, it‚Äôs the food that brings us all together. A ‚ÄòThali‚Äô is the epitome of ‚Äòcultural exploration‚Äô on a plate.ou restaurants belong to south india.<br>
                        Here are some south indian thallis:<br>
                         ANDHRA PRADESH:<br>
                          The Andhra Thali is complete only when it is served on a banana leaf. It begins with a liberal dose of ghee on boiled rice along with lentil followed by Charu ( a kind of rasam), avakaya (mango pickle) and various other delicacies usually ending with a sumptuous dose of perugu (curd rice). For dessert, you will be served Rava Laddoo or Bandhar Laddoo.<br>
                         
                         TELANGANA:<br>
                          The state of Telangana became a state separating from Andhra Pradesh very recently in 2013 and thus, both the states have the same eating habits and customs. Their Thalis are practically the same! But what separates the both is the spiritual significance of the festive Telangana Thali. The thali bursts with the flavourful goodness of the State‚Äôs myriad culinary traditions. The three thalis are vegetarian, non-vegetarian and seafood thalis. They don't believe in desserts, ‚ÄúTraditional Indian food has no concept of desserts, we offer sweets like gaval etc for the fest,‚Äù.<br>
                        
                         KANNADIGA OOTA THALI - KARNATAKA<br>
                          A typical Kannadiga Oota (Karnataka thali) is a beautiful blend of different flavors. There is no 'rule' to this thali and it contains liberal helpings of rice, sambhar, kootu. This Thali is brimming with variety which includes jolada roti (sorghum flatbread), akki roti (rice flatbread), padavalkayi masala (snakegourd curry), badane ennegai (stuffed brinjal), ranjaka (chilli-garlic chutney), gattisoppu (lentils and greens), mirchi bhajji (chilli fritters), kosambari (moong dal salad) and a bowl of homemade yoghurt.<br>
                        
                         KERALA SADHYA THALI - KERALA<br>
                          Indians are known for elaborate meals, and the Kerala Sadhya thali is an example of it at its best. Kerala‚Äôs food is generally hot and spicy. The food is traditionally eaten by hands and served in banana leaves. Abundant use of coconut oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves and coconut milk are used in their daily cooking. For dessert, there's paayasam (a sweet made with rice and lentils) to complete the meal.<br>
                        
                         TAMIL SAPPADU/ CHETTINAD THALI - TAMIL NADU<br>
                          There is no classic Tamil thali as each district and community in the state has its own signature recipes but the Sappadu & Chettinad does have some much-loved staples. They include curries, mixed vegetables, curd rice and sticky rice puddings. It even offers munchings such as Banana Chips, Chakli and Onion rings. Each dish on its own is a culinary specialty and this Thali is an adventure in itself!<br>
